# I320 — ARCH-035 E0/E1 host composition architecture baseline

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | Active (proposed; ineffective until governance claim merges) |
| Story | ARCH-035 / #897 |
| Scope | E0 dependency/code-truth inventory and E1 ADR / API placement only |
| Owner | @wjhuang88 |
| Claim | See authoritative ARCH-035 owner; no production implementation authorized |
| Dependency | STORE-002 / #670 remains Intake / Unclaimed; E2/E3 blocked |
| Coordination | #361 ServerHost, #360 remote adapter, CLI/TUI/Desktop/SDK |

## Objective

Record an exact-source-path matrix for host constructors and Runtime/Session/Memory/Evolution/Exploration ownership. Accept a minimal host-facing composition decision that delegates to existing local implementations and does not create any capability/domain storage contracts owned by #670.

## Execution gates

- E0: inspect runtime builder, session manager/store, CLI host, TUI renderer, Desktop and SDK call sites; classify persistence authority and compiled SQLite dependency; record baseline tests and negative/recovery invariants.
- E1: review ADR for local default host profile, domain ownership, builder source compatibility and the #670 no-duplication matrix.
- No E2/E3 code, schema, SQL, file format, migration, dependencies or Server behavior.
- Validate docs/governance and exact-head CI before acceptance.

## Existing evidence / initial inventory (read-only, 2026-11-10)

| Component | Verified path | Observation |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime SDK | `crates/talos-runtime/src/lib.rs` | Runtime facade and shared composition feature; inspect builder implementation in E0 |
| Session domain | `crates/talos-session/src/manager.rs` | SessionManager owns directory, index and SessionStore delegates; default CompactTextSessionStore + JsonlSessionStore |
| CLI host | `crates/talos-cli/src/main.rs` | CLI owns mode selection and session commands; storage and runtime adapter modules need full tracing |
| Storage owner | `docs/backlog/active/STORE-002-storage-capability-contracts.md` | #670 is unclaimed; capability interfaces/adapters cannot be duplicated here |

These are preliminary facts, not an E0-complete inventory or accepted ADR.

## Acceptance / residuals

- Full dependency matrix and code references reviewed.
- ADR accepted with #670 owner separation and API compatibility evidence.
- No production behavior or dependency change.
- E2/E3 remain explicitly blocked until #670 accepted seams.
- Required governance claim PR merged before any governed implementation.
- Independent API review and exact-head checks as applicable; no Completion Commit until existing evidence commit exists.

## Iteration inventory / parallel authorization

I319 search legacy dependency retirement has a separate proposed claim; I318 TUI native key repeat is in Review, I300 and other historical active work remain independently owned. This I320 scope is docs-only architecture and does not touch their code or ownership. Parallel non-overlap must be reconfirmed at merge-time CAS.
