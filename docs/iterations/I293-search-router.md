## Scope

- Add Talos-owned first-valid-success routing with bounded hedging and cancellation/deadline propagation.
- Preserve backend identity and typed failures, while keeping health state bounded and query-free.
- Keep paid providers explicit opt-in, Wikipedia as compatibility knowledge fallback, and rust-websearch as rollback adapter.

## Non-goals

No model-facing schema/output change, GeoIP or country routing, startup probe, generic retry/circuit-breaker system, new public crate, or provider admission.

## Acceptance

Deterministic fixtures cover first-valid-success, fast-error/slow-success, all-fail, invalid result, timeout, cancellation and bounded hedging. Locked tests, governance validation, focused review and rollback evidence pass.
