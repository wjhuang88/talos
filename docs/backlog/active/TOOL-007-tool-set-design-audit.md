# TOOL-007: Built-in Tool Set Design Audit

**Status**: Research
**Priority**: P2 (Medium-term)
**Source**: User request 2026-06-19
**Depends on**: TOOL-005/TOOL-006 (bash tool evolution); no implementation dependency

## Problem

Talos currently ships 22 built-in tools across 5 categories.  They were added
incrementally across multiple iterations (I003 through I026) without a holistic
design review.  As the tool set grows, the risk of overlapping functionality,
inconsistent design patterns, and agent confusion increases.

A comprehensive audit is needed to validate that the tool set is:
- **Orthogonal** — no two tools cover the same ground
- **Complete** — the agent can accomplish common coding tasks without
  resorting to `bash` as a crutch
- **Agent-friendly** — tool schemas, descriptions, and result formats help the
  model choose and use tools correctly
- **Safe** — the permission model accurately reflects each tool's real risk

## Research Questions

### 1. Orthogonality & Overlap

- [ ] Do `ls`, `tree`, and `glob` have overlapping use cases?  When should the
  model use one vs. another?  Are the descriptions clear enough?
- [ ] Does `stat` duplicate information available from `ls --long`?
- [ ] Do `grep` and `find_symbol` overlap for code search?  (grep searches
  text; find_symbol uses tree-sitter AST)
- [ ] Are there 10 git tools because git operations are fundamentally
  different, or because the tool set reflects git's CLI surface too literally?
  Could some be consolidated (e.g. `git_show` could be a `git` tool with a
  `subcommand` parameter)?
- [ ] Does `bash` serve as an escape hatch that makes other tools redundant?
  Is there a risk the model defaults to `bash` instead of using safer,
  purpose-built tools?

### 2. Coverage Gaps

- [ ] **Network**: No HTTP fetch tool exists.  The agent cannot read web pages,
  API docs, or download assets without `bash` + `curl`/`wget`.  (Tracked by
  WEBFETCH-001, but is this a P0 gap?)
- [ ] **Image reading**: `read` is text-only.  No tool for reading image files
  (screenshots, diagrams).  (Tracked by TOOL-003 residual)
- [ ] **Binary inspection**: No `hexdump` or `file`-type tool.
- [ ] **Environment inspection**: No tool for reading env vars, `$PATH`,
  installed tool versions.  (Model uses `bash which` / `bash --version`)
- [ ] **Config editing**: No structured config read/write tool.  Model edits
  TOML/JSON/YAML as raw text via `edit`.

### 3. Tool Granularity

- [ ] Is 22 tools the right number?  Too many tools increase prompt token
  cost and model decision complexity.  Too few force `bash` fallback.
- [ ] Do the 10 git tools justify their prompt real estate?  How often does
  the model actually use `git_branch_list` vs `git_push`?
- [ ] Should `diff` and `stat` be separate tools, or sub-operations of a
  unified inspection tool?

### 4. Tool Description Progressive Loading

Currently all 22 tool definitions (name, description, JSON Schema, summary
fields) are injected into the system prompt as a flat, static block before
every turn.  This approach has several drawbacks:

- **Token waste**: A session that never touches Git still pays for 10 Git
  tool schemas in every turn's prompt.  For a 30-turn session, this adds up
  to thousands of wasted tokens.
- **Model distraction**: Too many tool choices can degrade the model's ability
  to select the right one, especially for smaller/cheaper models.
- **Cache invalidation**: Adding one new tool invalidates the entire prompt
  cache prefix, even for sessions that never use that tool.

A progressive loading mechanism would inject tool descriptions on demand,
based on context signals:

| Trigger | Tools injected |
|---|---|
| Session start | Always-on tools: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `grep`, `glob`, `ls` |
| Agent reads a `.git` directory or mentions "commit" | Git tool family (`git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_log`, `git_show`, `git_branch_list`, `git_add`, `git_commit`, `git_push`, `git_pull`, `git_checkout`) |
| Agent navigates source code or asks "where is X defined" | Code intelligence tools (`find_symbol`, `find_references`, `list_symbols`, `list_imports`) |
| Agent compares files or inspects metadata | `diff`, `stat` |
| Agent explores directory structure | `tree` |

**Research questions**:
- [ ] What is the actual token cost of the full tool schema block vs a
  minimal "always-on" set?  (Measure with real prompt snapshots)
- [ ] How does the model behave when tools appear/disappear mid-session?
  Does it "forget" about previously available tools?  (Test with mock provider)
- [ ] What context signals are reliable triggers for tool injection?
  - File path patterns (`.git/` → git tools)
  - User message keywords ("find", "search" → code intelligence)
  - Agent action history (just ran `grep` on `.rs` → code intelligence likely needed)
- [ ] Should the model be able to explicitly request tool descriptions?
  (e.g. a meta-tool `request_tool_family("git")`)
- [ ] How does progressive loading interact with prompt caching?
  Can we design cache-friendly tool blocks that compose without full
  invalidation?
- [ ] What's the fallback when the model tries to use a tool whose
  description hasn't been loaded yet?  Auto-inject + retry?  Error?
- [ ] Does this align with or conflict with the `Skill` Level 1/2
  progressive activation model (SKILL-002)?  Can they share the same
  mechanism?

**Design constraints**:
- The `ToolRegistry` must remain the single source of truth for tool
  definitions — progressive loading is a *presentation* concern, not a
  *registration* concern.
- The prompt builder (`talos-agent/src/prompt.rs`) owns the injection
  logic; tools themselves are unchanged.
- The mechanism must degrade gracefully for providers that don't support
  mid-session tool list changes.

### 5. Agent Execution Logic

- [ ] **Tool selection patterns**: In real agent runs, which tools are used
  most?  Which are never used?  (Requires telemetry or session analysis)
- [ ] **Chaining**: Do tools compose well?  Can the model `read` → `edit` →
  `diff` → `git_commit` in a natural flow?
- [ ] **Error recovery**: When a tool fails (file not found, permission
  denied), is the error message actionable for the model?
- [ ] **Result size**: Do any tools produce outputs too large for model
  context?  Are truncation/summarization strategies consistent?

### 6. Permission Model Accuracy

- [ ] `git_push` and `git_pull` are classified as `Network` — is this
  correct?  Should they also be `Write` (push mutates remote)?
- [ ] `git_checkout` is classified as `Write` — is branch switching truly a
  write operation or a workspace state change?
- [ ] `delete` is `Write` — but directory deletion is substantially riskier
  than file deletion.  Should they be distinguished?
- [ ] `bash` is `Execute` — but the model can use it to `rm -rf`, `curl |
  sh`, or other dangerous operations.  Is the permission granularity
  sufficient?

### 7. Consistency & Naming

- [ ] Tool names follow no consistent convention: some are verbs (`read`,
  `write`), some are nouns (`diff`, `stat`), some have `git_` prefix.
- [ ] Parameter naming: `path` vs `file_path` vs `pattern` — is it
  consistent across tools?
- [ ] Description quality: Are descriptions specific enough for the model
  to choose correctly?  Compare `"Read file contents"` vs a description
  that mentions offset/limit, binary detection, and line number hint.

## Deliverables

1. **Tool design principles document** — Define what makes a good Talos tool:
   naming convention, description standard, parameter schema rules, result
   format guidelines.
2. **Orthogonality map** — Visual or tabular mapping of tool overlap and gaps.
3. **Recommendations** — Concrete proposals:
   - Tools to consolidate (merge or add subcommand parameter)
   - Tools to add (identified coverage gaps)
   - Tools to rename (consistency fixes)
   - Permission model adjustments
4. **Updated backlog items** — Any recommendations that become new stories.

## Non-goals

- Do not implement any tool changes as part of this research.
- Do not propose removing tools without analyzing agent usage patterns.
- Do not redesign the `AgentTool` trait or `ToolRegistry` — this audit is
  about the tool *set*, not the tool *infrastructure*.
